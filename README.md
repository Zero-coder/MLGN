# MLGN (Please stay tuned for further updates on our progress. Thank you for your interest in our work.)
Code release of paper ["Multi-Scale Local-Global Feature Learning Network for Long-term Series Forecasting"]([https://openreview.net](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad1436/pdf)/) 
MLGN achieve SOTA on six benchmarks.

##  Overall Architecture
As shown in Figure 1, we decompose the time series into seasonal part and trend part by Multi-scale Sequence Decomposition. For seasonal part, we use Seasonal Component Prediction block to predict. For trend part, we use a simple full-connected layer to predict.

### Seasonal Prediction block
The seasonal part contains several different patterns after Multi-scale Sequence Decomposition. For each pattern, we use local-global module to discovery local temporal features and global relations.

#### Local-Global module
We use down-sampling interactive learning convolution to capture local features and causal frequency enhancement module to discover global correlations.

## Get Started

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Data. All the six benchmark datasets can be obtained from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CC4ZrUD4EKncndzgy5PSTzOPSqcuyqqj/view?usp=sharing) or [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/b8f4a78a39874ac9893e/?dl=1).

3. Reproducibility. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts`. You can reproduce the experiments results by:

```
bash ./scipts/ETTm.sh
bash ./scipts/ETTh.sh
bash ./scipts/ECL.sh
bash ./scipts/Exchange.sh
bash ./scipts/Traffic.sh
bash ./scipts/WTH.sh
bash ./scipts/ILI.sh
```
